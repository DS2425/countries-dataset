    "After that, you need to execute the `app.py` script. Shiny needs this file to recognise it as the parent of the project to properly run it. It's strongly advised to keep your python console open, since it will provide the localhost URL in case you didn't install the extension before. If the extension was installed, you will be able to view and interact on the right of the screen with the dashboard.\n",
