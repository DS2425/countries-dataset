    "> - The questions must be stated, justified, and an additional question is proposed above the minimum of 2 or at least outlined with a study afterward (sometimes these extra questions are not made explicit but are still studied).\n",
    "> - We should make an exploratory data analysis (EDA) for each question.\n",
    "> - We must apply more than one advanced technique (statistical test or data mining algorithm). For example, one advanced technique per question.\n",
    "> - Conclusions must be consistent with the results and understandable, answering the questions of interest raised. Also, we have to interpret the conclusions within the context of the datasetâ€™s domain (e.g., therefore, treatment X is better than Y for treating fever, and the drug guides should be modified to improve the treatment of this type of symptom).\n",
    "> - We should include more than one correct and coherent visualization for the type of information being presented, making proper use of visual elements. For a higher grade, we should make use of advanced visualizations features of the libraries we use."
