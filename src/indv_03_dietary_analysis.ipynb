Now this is not to say that diet does not have an impact on life expectancy, but rather that the overall factors of a society or cultural diets, such as mediterranean, assian, etc. don't seem to directly correlate with life expectancy. So what can we extract from this then?\n",

    "The measurable differences seem to be:\n",
    "- Countries with a high GDP per capita consume mosre fats and oils. Countries with a GDP lower than that don't seem to have much difference between them.\n",
    "- The higher the income, the more meat is consumed proportionally, although countries with mid and high GDP per capita have a similar consumption.\n",
    "- Starchy roots seem to be consumed more in countries with lower GDP per capita. The more money a country has, the less starchy roots are consumed, although this could be due to diet differences as most of the countries with low GDP per capita are in Africa. Something similar happens with cereals and grain. Although it is noteworthy that the consumpition of this last food type is the most prevalent across all countries.\n",
    "- Pulses seem to be mostly consumed in countries with very low GDP per capita. In this case these are the only countries that show a consuption of this kind of food, so we are more inclined to think that this is a cultural thing rather than an economic one.\n",
    "- Sugar seems to almost double in consupmtion in countries where the GDP per capita is higher than the \"Very Low\". But as it's increment is only shown in the lower consumption by the \"Very Low\" group, we are more inclined to think that this may have to do with how food is processed and distributed in developed and developing countries.\n",
    "- Other than that, the consumption of fruits and vegetables, and other commodities do not seem to have a significant difference between countries with different GDP per capita.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the difference does not seem as big as we would have expected, but it is still significant. This means that our hypothesis $H_{2\\_1}$ is supported by the data, but $H_{2\\_2}$ is not, or at least, it's only partially supported, as we assumed that both the consumption of meat and sugar would increase with GDP per capita, but only meat consumption seems to have a significant increment related to GDP per capita."
